# Git Management Plan for GENBOOK.AI

## Repository Status
Your git repository for GENBOOK.AI has been successfully fixed and is now properly connected to your remote repository at https://github.com/Yashkatiyar24/GENBOOK.AI.git.

## Current Status
- Local repository: Initialized and configured
- Remote repository: Connected and synchronized
- Git configuration: Username and email set
- Branch: main (default branch)

## Ongoing Git Management Best Practices

### 1. Daily Workflow
1. **Start of day**: Pull latest changes from remote
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **During development**: Commit frequently with meaningful messages
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Brief description of changes"
   ```

3. **End of day**: Push your changes to remote
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### 2. Branching Strategy
- Use `main` branch for production-ready code
- Create feature branches for new functionality:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name
  ```
- Merge feature branches after review and testing:
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git merge feature/new-feature-name
  git push origin main
  ```

### 3. Commit Message Guidelines
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Be concise but descriptive
- Start with a capital letter
- Examples:
  - "Add authentication component"
  - "Fix schedule display bug"
  - "Update database schema"

### 4. Handling Conflicts
If you encounter merge conflicts:
1. Pull the latest changes:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
2. Resolve conflicts in the affected files
3. Stage and commit the resolved files:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
   ```

### 5. Backup and Recovery
- Your code is automatically backed up on GitHub
- To restore to a previous commit:
  ```bash
  git log --oneline
  git reset --hard <commit-hash>
  ```

## Common Git Commands Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `git status` | Check repository status |
| `git log --oneline` | View commit history |
| `git diff` | See changes since last commit |

## Troubleshooting Tips

1. **If you can't push changes**: Try pulling first
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **If you accidentally delete files**: Restore them
   ```bash
   git checkout -- <file-name>
   ```

3. **If you need to undo the last commit**: 
   ```bash
   git reset --soft HEAD~1
   ```
